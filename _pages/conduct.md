title: Code of conduct
---

The organizers of the workshop are dedicated to creating a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender,
gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age or religion. 
This document is conceived to ensure we ensure we offer a hospitable and inclusive event, and a list of resources for reporting violations. 

All participants of the workshop, including students, instructors, staff, and guests, are requested to respect and follow the code of conduct. 

### Definition of prohibited conduct

Following the [United Nation Secretary General bulletin](http://daccess-ods.un.org/access.nsf/Get?Open&DS=ST/SGB/2008/5&Lang=E), we include the following adapted relevant definitions. 
- Discrimination is any unfair treatment or arbitrary distinction based on a person’s race, sex, religion, nationality, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, disability, age, language, social origin or other status. Discrimination may be an isolated event affecting one person or a group of persons similarly situated, or may manifest itself through harassment or abuse of authority.  
- Harassment is any improper and unwelcome conduct that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offense or humiliation to another person. Harassment may take the form of words, gestures or actions which tend to annoy, alarm, abuse, demean, intimidate, belittle, humiliate or embarrass another or which create an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. 
- Sexual harassment is any unwelcome sexual advance, request for sexual favour, verbal or physical conduct or gesture of a sexual nature, or any other behaviour of a sexual nature that might reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation to another, when such conduct interferes with work, is made a condition of employment or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. While typically involving a pattern of behavior, it can take the form of a single incident. Sexual harassment may occur between persons independently of their gender identity.
- Abuse of authority is the improper use of a position of influence, power or authority against another person. This is particularly serious when a person uses their influence, power or authority to improperly influence the career or employment conditions of another, including, but not limited to, appointment, assignment, contract renewal, performance evaluation or promotion. Abuse of authority may also include conduct that creates a hostile or offensive work environment which includes, but is not limited to, the use of intimidation, threats, blackmail or coercion.

### Unacceptable behavior

Any form of prohibited conduct including but not limited to discrimination, harassment, sexual harassment and abuse of authority are unacceptable during the workshop. 
Examples of prohibited behavior include
- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Unwelcome verbal or written comment or physical conduct based on race, religion, color, body size, sex (with or without sexual conduct and including pregnancy and sexual orientation involving transgender status/gender identity, and sex-stereotyping), national origin, age, disability, genetic information, sexual orientation, gender identity, parental status, marital status, or political affiliation.
- Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
- Inappropriate photography or recording. You should have someone’s consent before taking their photograph and/or recording their voice
- Inappropriate physical contact.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following.
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
- Disruption of workshop events, including meetings, lectures and presentations.
Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. 
Failure to comply will result in the participant being expelled from the event at the discretion of the organizers or the research station manager.

### Expected behavior

We expect all participants, including students, instructors, staff and guests, to act in ways that support a learning community at all event venues and event-related social activities. We expect you to support collaboration and learning while participating in this community of practice. The following behaviors are expected and requested for all workshop participants. 
- Practice empathy and humility. Be mindful that each workshop participant came from different backgrounds and we are all here together to learn and thrive together.
- Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Share analysis and opinions rather than accusations
- Assume that everyone we work with is doing their best work to create a positive research and learning space. 
- Listen carefully and actively. Ask questions, and seek to understand your partners' context. Encourage other people to listen as much as they speak.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Treat other people's identities and cultures with respect. Make an effort to say people's names correctly and refer to them by their stated pronouns.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.
- Alert workshop organizers or research stations managers if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
- Follow instructions by Finse research station management/director regarding safety and use of station facilities.
This is not an exhaustive list of all the principles to create a welcoming community, and we welcome participants in looking for ways of building an inclusive community within the workshop.
