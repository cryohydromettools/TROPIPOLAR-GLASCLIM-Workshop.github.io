If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at mlglaciology.workshop@gmail.com.

## ¿Quién puede participar?

Anyone interested in using machine learning techniques in glaciology. Some experience in  programming (ideally in Python) is required. Since the focus is on "hands-on" project work we also require some basic knowledge in machine learning prior to the workshop. 
<!---
We received 67 applications and selected 27 participants.

## Entorno informático

The workshop infrastructure for applications using GPUs (i.e. remote sensing) will be provided by [CloudFerro](https://cloudferro.com/en/) and applicants will have access to the EO data archive on [CREODIAS](https://creodias.eu/). For CPU-based applications (i.e. modelling) a JupyterHub will be available from [CryoCloud](https://cryointhecloud.com) with all data and dependencies already pre-installed.

## Ubicación
The workshop will be held at the [Finse Alpine Research Center](https://www.finse.uio.no/) run by Oslo and Bergen University. The station is located near the >70 km2 Hardangerjøkulen Ice Cap with one of the outlet glaciers 1-2 km away and well visible from the Research Station. Finse is a tiny mountain village with only a few houses located at the Oslo - Bergen railroad at 1,222 meters (4,009 ft) above sea level, about 250 m above the treeline. There is no road to Finse. Facilities are very limited, e.g., there is no grocery store, pharmacy or bank. Temperatures in Finse in September are around 0-15 degree Celcius, snow fall is possible. 
<!---
In April there will be lots of snow and temperatures can be well below freezing with high winds.

## Transporte
Finse is only accessible by train, from either Oslo central station (Oslo S) (ca. 4.5 hrs; ca. 6 trains per day between ca. 6:00 and 23:00; ca. 600 NOK one way) or Bergen (ca. 2.5 hrs). Tickets to and from Finse can be bought at [vy.no](https://www.vy.no). The earlier you book the cheaper the tickets and tickets are sold out quickly. From Finse train station it is a 15-20 minute walk (ca. 1.5 km) along a small dirt road/hiking path to the research station. 
 
### Aeropuerto Lima a Huaraz
From the airport you need to take a train to the central train station (Oslo S) where the train to Finse departs. Turn to the right when getting out of customs and walk about 50 m where you can buy the train ticket to Oslo at a counter or ticket machine. There are two independent companies selling tickets side by side:
- Flytoget (flight train), fastest, ca. 20 minutes, 220 NOK
- "Normal" train by [vy.no](https://www.vy.no), ca. 30 minutes, ~115 NOK. This train may actually get you faster to Oslo depending when you get there since it goes more often. Trains R10, R11 and L12 go to Oslo.
 
You can also buy the tickets online ([vy.no](https://www.vy.no) or [flytoget](https://flytoget.no/en/)). From the ticket counter/machines it is a 2 minute walk to the platform (down the escalator).
 
### Airport Flesland to Bergen
Line 1 of the city light rail (“bybanen” in Norwegian) links the airport with central Bergen and the train station. Tickets cost 39 NOK and takes about 40 minutes. Tickets can be bought on the skyss app or on the machines at the station. There is also an [airport bus](https://flybussen.no) which costs 149 NOK one way and takes about 25 minutes. 

## Fechas de llegada/salida
The workshop starts at Finse on Friday, 6 September 2024 at 6PM and ends on Thursday, 12 September 12 at 2pm. All participants are required to attend the entire course, i.e. it is not possible to come later or leave earlier.

## Alojamiento / comidas
All participants will be housed at the Finse Research Station (run by the Universities of Oslo and Bergen) which has a number of 2-4 bed rooms which participants will share. We will be the only group at the station at that time. A cook at the station will provide all meals for the workshop (dietary restrictions can be accommodated). 
The first meal during the workshop will be dinner on Friday at 7pm. The last meal will be a lunchbox (Norwegian "matpakke") on Thursday. Please bring you own food and beverages for your travel journeys and stay if wished as there is no grocery store in Finse. The station has a small lecture hall and internet (4G eduroam and University of Oslo guest login).
